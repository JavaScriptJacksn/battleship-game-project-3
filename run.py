TACTICAL SIMULATION TRAINER\n
TOP SECRET\n

Welcome, operative.\n
Our great organisation is under a great threat,
with enemy ships approaching our
vessels positioned in the pacific ocean.\n
As you know, they guard a hidden treasureâ€¦ The Lost City of Atlantis.\n
It is your mission to practise and perfect tactical ship placement
and offensive manuevers in this cutting-edge simulation.\n
Our livelyhoods rest on your shoulders.\n
Note: Games last until the final ship is hit, game length/difficulty
scales with the size of board.\n
Good Luck.
